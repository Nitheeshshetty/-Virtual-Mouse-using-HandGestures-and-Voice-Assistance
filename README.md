Virtual-Mouse-using-HandGestures-and-Voice-Assistance
-----------------------------------------------------
Gesture-controlled laptops and computers have recently gained a lot of traction. Leap motion is the name for this technique. This paper proposes a way to control the position of the cursor with the bare hands without using any electronic device. The mouse is one of the wonderful inventions of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) technology. Currently, wireless mouse or a Bluetooth mouse still uses devices and is not free of devices completely since it uses a battery for power and a dongle to connect it to the PC. The Virtual Mouse provides an infrastructure between the user and the system using only a camera. It allows users to interface with machines without the use of mechanical or physical devices, and even control mouse functionalities.

The software’s that will be required to implement the proposed system are OpenCV and python. The output of the camera will be displayed on the system’s screen so that it can be further calibrated by the user. Based on the hand gestures, the computer can be controlled virtually and can perform left click, right click, scrolling functions, and computer cursor function without the use of the physical mouse. The python dependencies that will be used for implementing this system are NumPy, math, wx and mouse. For voice recognition we make use of Speech Recognition, PyAudio, pyttsx3, pywhatkit.
