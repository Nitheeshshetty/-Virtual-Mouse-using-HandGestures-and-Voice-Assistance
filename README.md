Virtual-Mouse-using-HandGestures-and-Voice-Assistance
-----------------------------------------------------
Gesture-controlled laptops and computers have recently gained a lot of traction. Leap motion is the name for this technique. This paper proposes a way to control the position of the cursor with the bare hands without using any electronic device. The mouse is one of the wonderful inventions of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) technology. Currently, wireless mouse or a Bluetooth mouse still uses devices and is not free of devices completely since it uses a battery for power and a dongle to connect it to the PC. The Virtual Mouse provides an infrastructure between the user and the system using only a camera. It allows users to interface with machines without the use of mechanical or physical devices, and even control mouse functionalities.
